# Agent Instructions

Guidance for agents working in this repository. Read this before changing
tracked files.

## Commit gates

Prefer Makefile targets over running commands directly. Run the gates
sequentially rather than in parallel; this repository relies on build caching,
and sequential runs benefit from it.

Run the full sequence before committing:

```bash
make check-fmt
make lint
make typecheck
make test
```

`make typecheck` runs the Codex skill-creator `quick_validate.py` over changed
skills when the tool is installed, and prints a warning and skips that check
when it is not; a missing skill-creator is not a reason to stop.

## Changes under `skills/`

Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` whose YAML frontmatter is an
Agent Skills manifest. The manifest `name` is the discovery name; a skill whose
manifest omits it is not discoverable by a strict loader.

`make lint` depends on `skill-manifest-check`, so the manifest contract is
already enforced by the standard gate sequence above. When adding, renaming, or
editing anything under `skills/`, the following are required:

- Run `make lint`. It runs `skill-frontmatter-lint` (`yamllint` over each
  extracted frontmatter block) and `skill-manifest-validate` (`skills-ref
  validate` over each skill directory). Both must pass before committing.
- Run `make test`. `tests/test_skill_manifests.py` asserts that every shipped
  manifest satisfies the contract, and that `make lint` still enforces it.
- Keep the directory name equal to the manifest `name`.
- Keep `metadata` a mapping of strings to strings. `skills-ref` coerces every
  value with `str(v)` rather than rejecting other shapes, so a list or mapping
  value passes validation but reaches consumers as a Python repr. Encode
  multi-valued entries as a single string.

Do not weaken these checks to make a manifest pass. Fix the manifest instead of
excluding it from `SKILL_DIRS` or relaxing the `yamllint` configuration.

To check one skill or a fixture while iterating:

```bash
make skill-manifest-check SKILL_DIRS=skills/changelog/
```
